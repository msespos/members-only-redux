A Rails application created as part of work with the Odin Project.

Users can log in to the site and write posts. Any visitor to the site can see the content of the posts; however, only logged-in members can post or see the author of any post.

This is Members Only "Redux" because I am returning to the Odin Project after a brief hiatus and want to redo the most recent project I've finished before I move on.
